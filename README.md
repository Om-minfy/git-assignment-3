## 2. Brief explanation of how the conflict was resolved

- Both branches changed the same file `index.html` in different ways.  
- The `feature` branch added styling and updated the paragraph.  
- The `add-content` branch updated the paragraph with different content.  
- When merging, Git showed a conflict because both modified the same section.  
- I opened the file and manually kept both the styling and the content changes.  
- Then I saved the file, committed the resolved version, and completed the merge successfully.

## 3. About Husky(Assignment-4)
      Husky is a tool that helps make sure our code is clean and follows rules before we save or share it. It does this by running checks automatically when we try to commit or push code. This 
      way, we donâ€™t have to worry about forgetting to check things like errors or formatting. It also makes sure everyone on the team is following the same rules, which keeps the project 
      organized. Overall, Husky saves time and helps avoid mistakes by automating these checks for us.
